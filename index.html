                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>My full name is Christopher Sebastian B. Candava, but you can call me Basti. I am a 20 year-old third-year Computer Science student at Cavite State University - Bacoor Campus. While I initially set my sights on engineering, I didn’t quite achieve the grades necessary to pursue that path. As a result, I turned to Computer Science, and to my surprise, I found a new passion for the field. As I began to learn more about the field, I discovered its vast potential and quickly grew to appreciate the endless possibilities it offers. I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

                <h2>INTEREST</h2>
                <p>As I’m just starting out in coding, I’m motivated to learn and understand different concepts and languages, aiming to build a strong foundation for future projects. I’m especially interested in finding practical ways to apply what I learn. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing sports, chess, online games, and solving math equations. I lso like to read different books of different genres, mainly manga or anything new that interests me,  which helps me stay focused, inspired and motivated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>GOALS</h2>
                <p>My primary goal for now is to complete my Computer Science degree and graduate, learning, growing, and gaining a solid understanding of the field and preparing for future opportunities. After graduation, I plan to gain hands-on experience in the field, taking a measured approach to growth and development. I’m focused on learning continuously and steadily building my career, one step at a time.</p>
